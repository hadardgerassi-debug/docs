title: Setup description: Install and set up quickly
Follow these steps to set up:

Create or open your GitHub repo connected to Mintlify.
Ensure docs.json includes the “Quick start” group (already done).
Add the quick-start pages (this page and the others).
Preview your site (Mintlify Cloud/Vercel/Netlify) and refresh.
Tips

Commit every change in GitHub so the site updates.
Paths in docs.json should not include .mdx.
